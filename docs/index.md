# Purse

Purse is a fork of the [default Roblox backpack] decoupled from the CoreGui, allowing developers to access APIs that were previously unavailable and to modify the code.

* Source code modification
* Developer APIs for controlling the inventory
* Not reliant on CoreGui permissions

Purse is not a major improvement over the CoreGui backpack; it is a copy of it, so developers can iterate on it themselves. There are no additional features beyond what the CoreGui backpack provides.

## Demo

You can play the [Purse Demo] on Roblox to try out Purse before using it. The place is uncopylocked so you can access an editable copy of the experience

## Notes

Because we can't access the topbar without CoreGui, we use [TopbarPlus]. This is one of the major differences in terms of functionality. TopbarPlus may be less familiar when used with a controller.
