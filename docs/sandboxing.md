[Script capabilities] are used to sandbox Purse and tools to ensure safety and prevent malicious code.

This is optional and disabled by default, but it can be enabled using the [`Sandboxed`][Sandboxed] property.

!!! warning

    By enabling script capabilities, all tools will be sandboxed. Make sure the [`Capabilities`][Capabilities] required by your tools are set on Purse or they will error.
