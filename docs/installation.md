Purse is available on the [Creator Store], [Wally], and [GitHub Releases].

Satchel uses [RunContext] to run anywhere, so you do not need to move it from [Workspace], though it is recommeneded to parent to [`ReplicatedStorage`][ReplicatedStorage] for best practices and organizational reasons.

!!! danger

    Do not parent the Purse to any starter containers or it will run multiple times.
