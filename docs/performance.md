Purse only runs on the client and has zero performance impact on the server.

All performance benchmarks are measured on the client using the [Developer Console] in Roblox Studio testing.

  [Developer Console]: https://create.roblox.com/docs/en-us/studio/developer-console

!!! note

    Benchmarks may be optimistic due to the optimization level of the Luau compiler in Studio testing being lower than in live games.
